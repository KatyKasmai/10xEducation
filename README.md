10x Education Curriculum

## Vision, Mission & Goals

#### Vision
Children growing up happy and fulfilled, and feeling driven to pursue their passion and know they can have a meaningful impact and improve lives. 

#### Mission
To shift the educational curriculum from one that prepares children for jobs to one that prepares children to solve problems they care about and build the solutions.

#### Goals
1. Orient the school year around a 10x idea and project that the child defines.
2. A teacher's primary role becomes to guide children on how to break down their problems and solutions into milestones, how to research for potential solutions, and encourage children to fail fast and iterate.
3. Subjects such as mathematics, computer science, reading, arts, etc. will orient themselves so as to demonstrate to children that what they are learning they can apply directly to enhancing their 10x projects.
