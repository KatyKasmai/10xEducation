# Exponential Education Curriculum

>Exponential Education (10xEducation.org) *is an open source education framework for learning, solving and building. We are just getting started here, so the content is draft. We are currently working with public schools in Manhattan to pilot and implement, starting with 10x Moonshot Sprints (conducted by http://teamX.co)*.

>## Why 10x Education?
The nature of work, jobs, life and our plant has changed significantly since the standard schedule and curriculum of our education system was first conceptualized. Yet we continue to adopt the same model in our public schools despite our changing needs. As a result, many students are not prepared to face the challenges of our world and are leaving high schools without a sense of who they are and what they are capable of accomplishing.

>The 10x Education model is a holistic approach to learning. While project-based, 10x Education encourages children to realize and work on problems they are passionate about and want to positively impact. This means that we don’t ask children “what do you want to be when you grow up”, but rather “what problem do you want to solve and what do you want to build now”. 


## Vision, Mission & Goals

#### Vision
Children growing up happy and fulfilled, and feeling driven to pursue their passion and know they can have a meaningful impact and improve lives. 

#### Mission
To shift the educational curriculum from one that prepares children for jobs to one that prepares children to solve problems they care about and build the solutions.

#### Goals
1. Orient the school year around a 10x idea and project that the child researches and defines.
2. A teacher's primary role becomes to guide children on how to break down their problems and solutions into milestones, how to research for potential solutions, and encourage children to fail fast, iterate and keep going.
3. Subjects such as mathematics, computer science, reading, arts, etc. will orient themselves so as to demonstrate to children that what they are learning can be directly applied to enhancing their 10x projects.

## Principles

- Start with a 10x Moonshot Sprint (see Appendix: Moonshot Sprint).
- Think 10x but then break the problem down into milestones and a pilot project.
- Pursue solving problems that you are passionate about.
- You must fail often and fail fast.
- Positive collaboration means saying “Yes, And!” to your teammates and yourself.
- Research to find the existing solutions and develop better ones.
- No project is ever final and done.
- Teachers are guides for children to use skills they will always need, such as problem-solving and teamwork. Teachers can not be expected to be the harbors of all information as this would not be a scalable solution. At the rate at which information is growing and changing, no one person can keep up fast enough to continuously and consistently disseminate the information to students. 
- Students need to learn how to research to find the relevant information they need, usually by navigating the internet and interviewing relevant subject matter experts, and then applying and testing the material directly against their projects.
- Students should have regularly scheduled access to a makerspace where they can ideate, prototype and build with their research and other skills and knowledge they have acquired(see Appendix: Makerspace).
- Students are guided on how to work in high-impact teams and how to be an effective team member (see Appendix: High-Impact Teams).

## Implementation
**Uncover a problem**: At the start of each year, children from 1st grade through 12th grade are encouraged to think about problems in our world that they care about. This process may require several sessions of exploring in the classroom some of humanity's most difficult challenges, and then asking students to do some research at home with a parent or other trusted adult to dig more deeply in order to uncover the student’s passion. 
>Here we will provide some content to help teachers and parents navigate conversations with students at school and at home in order to help them understand what sorts of problems humanity faces now and may in the future.

There is a lot of emphasis on ensuring the child is pursuing problem areas and solutions they are passionate about because 10x solutions require patience and perseverance, which can only come from a place of passion. If we find the child is giving up on the pursuit early on, then it is most likely that this was not a problem/solution they were truly passionate about, and the child requires additional guidance in discovering other options. 

**Ideate solutions**: Once the student has selected a problem area that they care about, the teacher guides the children through a Moonshot Sprint that will help them ideate and discover potential 10x solutions individually. Children that are working on related problem areas should be encouraged (but not forced) to collaborate and work on a project together.

There is a lot of emphasis on ensuring the child is pursuing a 10x Moonshot solution. Moonshots and 10x thinking are themselves a source of energy and excitement, and they tend to attract a greater force of pursuit. As we get older, we start to feel discouraged from pursuing audacious and radical solutions, but children are unbridled and Exponential Education aims to cultivate and nurture this important quality and mindset. 

**Select a 10x project path**: The Moonshot Sprint will guide students in ensuring that their problem solution and project are at a 10x level or greater. Once a final project vision is established, teachers guide the students into breaking the problem down into milestones and an initial pilot. The pilot is what the student will spend the rest of the academic year prototyping.

**Build a pilot of the 10x project**: Each student will create a project plan for their 10x project pilot. The project plan will include a list of materials needed and estimated costs, and will demonstrate the intention and use of each item. The 10x project and pilot plan can then be presented to parents and the local community through a "pitch" event where the student will demonstrate their intended value and impact in order to receive constructive feedback and attract "investor" funding. Collected funds can be used by the students to purchase the materials for their pilot project.

 These are the ingredients of a high-impact team:
 
1. A Clear Elevating Goal
2. Results-driven Structure
3. Competent team members
4. Unified commitment
5. Collaborative climate
6. Standards of excellence
7. External support and recognition
8. Principled leadership

#### 1. A Clear Elevating Goal
- A clear understanding of the goal to be achieved and a belief that the goal embodies a worthwhile or important result
- A clear understanding of the nature of the problem leads to more effective solving
  - set team objectives (OKR)
    - create specific performance objectives e.g. Placing a person on the moon.
    - what you are doing and why
    - set a personal challenge
    - have a sense of urgency

#### 2. Results-driven Structure
	There are 3 main types of results-driven structure:
- *Problem resolution*: the most important and necessary feature of the team is trust. Each member of the team must believe that interactions among members will be truthful, consistent and mature, and that each member will be treated with respect.
- *Create something*: the necessary feature of the team structure is autonomy from systems and procedures, and abandonment of normative thinking.
- *Tactical*: to execute a well-defined plan, there must be a high task clarity and unambiguous role definition.

>Universal needs:
- Clear Roles and accountability
  - Defined results
  - Everyone is accountable all the time
- An effective communication system
  - Information easily accessible
  - Credible sources of information
  - Opportunity to raise issues
  - Document issues raised and decisions made
- Monitoring individual performance and providing feedback
- Fact-based judgement

#### 3. Competent team members
- Possess necessary technical skills
- Personal characteristic to achieve excellence and work well with others

#### 4. Unified commitment
- A sense of loyalty and dedication to team

#### 5. Collaborative climate
- *Trust*: honesty, integrity, no lies, no exaggeration
- *Openness*: willingness to share and a receptivity to information, perceptions, ideas
  - Being encouraged to take risks, and given permission to fail.
  - Positive collaboration means saying “Yes, And!” to your teammates and yourself.
- *Consistency*: predictable behavior and responses
- *Respect*: treating people with dignity and fairness

#### 6. Standards of excellence
	Pressure to perform
  - Individual standards
  - Team pressure
  - Consequences
  - External pressure

#### 7. External support and recognition
- Tangible resources

#### 8. Principled leadership
- *Creating attention through vision*: creating a focus that is compelling and results-oriented
- *Creating meaning through communication*: the capacity to relate a compelling image that is fostered through shared meanings, symbols and images powerful enough to induce enthusiasm and commitment
- *Establishing trust through positioning*: leaders behavior exemplifies the ideals and course of the vision
