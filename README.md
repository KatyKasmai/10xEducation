# 10x Education Model

>## Why 10x Education?
The nature of work, jobs, life and our plant has changed significantly since the standard schedule and curriculum of our education system was first conceptualized. Yet we continue to adopt the same model in our public schools despite our changing needs. As a result, many students are not prepared to face the challenges of our world and are leaving high schools without a sense of who they are and what they are capable of accomplishing.

>The 10x Education model is a holistic approach to learning. While project-based, 10x Education encourages children to realize and work on problems they are passionate about and believe they can positively impact. This means that we don’t ask children “what do you want to be when you grow up”, but rather “what problem do you want to solve and what do you want to build now”. 


## Vision, Mission & Goals

#### Vision
Children growing up happy and fulfilled, and feeling driven to pursue their passion and know they can have a meaningful impact and improve lives. 

#### Mission
To shift the educational curriculum from one that prepares children for jobs to one that prepares children to solve problems they care about and build the solutions.

#### Goals
1. Orient the school year around a 10x idea and project that the child defines.
2. A teacher's primary role becomes to guide children on how to break down their problems and solutions into milestones, how to research for potential solutions, and encourage children to fail fast and iterate.
3. Subjects such as mathematics, computer science, reading, arts, etc. will orient themselves so as to demonstrate to children that what they are learning they can apply directly to enhancing their 10x projects.
