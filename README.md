# 10x Education Model

>10xEducation.org is an open source education framework for learning, solving and building. We are just getting started here, so the **content is draft**. We are currently working with public schools in Manhattan to pilot and implement, starting with 10x Moonshot Sprints (conducted by http://teamX.co).

>## Why 10x Education?
The nature of work, jobs, life and our plant has changed significantly since the standard schedule and curriculum of our education system was first conceptualized. Yet we continue to adopt the same model in our public schools despite our changing needs. As a result, many students are not prepared to face the challenges of our world and are leaving high schools without a sense of who they are and what they are capable of accomplishing.

>The 10x Education model is a holistic approach to learning. While project-based, 10x Education encourages children to realize and work on problems they are passionate about and believe they can positively impact. This means that we don’t ask children “what do you want to be when you grow up”, but rather “what problem do you want to solve and what do you want to build now”. 


## Vision, Mission & Goals

#### Vision
Children growing up happy and fulfilled, and feeling driven to pursue their passion and know they can have a meaningful impact and improve lives. 

#### Mission
To shift the educational curriculum from one that prepares children for jobs to one that prepares children to solve problems they care about and build the solutions.

#### Goals
1. Orient the school year around a 10x idea and project that the child defines.
2. A teacher's primary role becomes to guide children on how to break down their problems and solutions into milestones, how to research for potential solutions, and encourage children to fail fast and iterate.
3. Subjects such as mathematics, computer science, reading, arts, etc. will orient themselves so as to demonstrate to children that what they are learning they can apply directly to enhancing their 10x projects.

##Principles

- Start with a 10x Moonshot Sprint (details to follow).
- Think 10x but then break the problem down into milestones and pilot projects.
- Pursue solving problems that you are passionate about.
- You must fail often and fail fast.
- Positive collaboration means saying “Yes, And!” to your teammates and yourself.
- Research to find the existing solutions and develop better ones.
- No project is ever final and done.

1. Teachers are guides for kids to use skills they will always need, such as problem-solving and teamwork. Teachers can not be expected to be the harbors of all information, it’s just not a scalable solution. At the rate at which information is growing and changing, no one person can keep up fast enough to continuously and consistently disseminate the information to students. Students need to learn how to find the information they need, usually by learning to navigate the internet and interview relevant subject matter experts, and then apply and test the material against to their projects.
